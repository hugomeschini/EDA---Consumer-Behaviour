# EDA---Consumer-Behaviour
EDA - Consumer Behavior

The Bridge School - Data Science Bootcamp

Data Analytics - EDA project (10/15 minuetes presentation)

Project required for the Data Analytics module. 
The topic was chosen by me and the Dataset was available in Kaggle, so I cannot guarantee that the information contained in the document is correct and true. 
Although would be possible to perform different analysis, my project respected the orientations provided by The Bridge Bootcamp, which means that my analysis should be presented in around 10-15 minutes.

I worked only with a jyupyter notebook, where I detailed all the adopted process (Structure Data, Data Preprocessing, Eloration, Insights, etc.)

This was the first EDA project I could develop.
