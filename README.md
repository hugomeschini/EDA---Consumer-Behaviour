# EDA---Consumer-Behaviour
EDA - Consumer Behavior

The Bridge School - Data Science Bootcamp

Data Analytics - EDA project (10/15 minuetes presentation)

Project required for the Data Analytics module. 
The topic was chosen by me and I got the Dataset from internet, so I cannot guarantee that the information contained in the document is correct and true. 
Although it was possible to carry out several analysis, my project respected the orientations provided by The Bridge Bootcamp, which means that my analysis should be presented in around 10-15 minutes.

I worked only with a jupyter notebook, where I detailed all the adopted processes (Structure, Preprocessing, Analysis, Insights, etc.). You can also find my presentation (pptx) with my findings and explantions (storytelling).

This was the first EDA project I could develop.
